### React App Structure
The top level directory structure will be as follows:

- <b>assets</b> - global static assets such as images, svgs, company logo, etc.
- <b>components</b> - global shared/reusable components, such as layout (wrappers, navigation), form components, buttons
- <b>services</b> - JavaScript modules
- <b>store</b> - Global Redux store
- <b>utils</b> - Utilities, helpers, constants, and the like
- <b>views</b> - Can also be called "pages", the majority of the app would be contained here
